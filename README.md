# GiraffeOrElephant

As part of the introductory course on Android development at Udacity, a task was issue to create a basic app. I change my wallpaper between exotic animals, so I thought why not make my app show a Giraffe or an Elephant based on clicking a button? It turns out to be quite simple to change an image from code.
